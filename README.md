## 🎥 BroCode YouTube Playlist

I’ve been learning Java by following the [BroCode YouTube Playlist](https://youtu.be/xTtL8E4LzTQ?si=ICxsQNRMjLp5doK9). This playlist is an excellent resource for beginners, covering a wide range of topics, including:
- Java basics (syntax, data types, loops, etc.)
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts
- Advanced topics like multithreading, collections, and more.

Feel free to explore the code I’ve written while following the playlist. Your feedback and suggestions are always welcome!
