# My Java Learning Journey

Welcome to my GitHub repository! This is where I document my journey of learning Java through the "BrooCode" YouTube playlist and showcase my personal projects.

## 🎥 BroCode YouTube Playlist

I have been learning Java by following the [BroCode YouTube Playlist](https://youtu.be/xTtL8E4LzTQ?si=ICxsQNRMjLp5doK9). This playlist covers various topics and is a great resource for beginners.

- **[Rock Paper Scissors](RockPaperScissors.java)**: A console game of rock paper scissors!
